{% block subject %}Membership in '{{ group_name }}' set to expire{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
{{ group_name }} is an audited group, but you are not an auditor. Because of this, your
membership in {{ group_name }} has been set to expire. You may resolve this by becoming an
auditor and then having an owner or np-owner in {{ group_name }} reset your expiration time.
For more information on how to become an auditor, please see {{ url }}/help.
