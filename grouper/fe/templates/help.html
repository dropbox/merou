<h3>What is Grouper?</h3>
<p>This is a group membership and permission management platform. In other words, we are an
authorization service you can use to answer such questions as: who's in what groups, and what
permissions do they have?</p>

<h3>How does group membership work?</h3>
<p>There are just three things to know: <a href="/users">users</a> are members
of <a href="/groups">groups</a>, groups can be members of other groups, and group
membership is transitive (if A is a member of B and B is a member of C, then A is a member
of C.) That's all there is to it.  Technically speaking, the users and groups constitute
the nodes of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed
acyclic graph</a> and a user or group is a member of any of its ancestors.</p>

<h3>What's the difference between the member, manager, owner, and np-owner roles?</h3>
<p>These are the types of group membership for users: a member just inherits the group's
permissions, a manager is a member who is additionally allowed to process requests to join
a group, and an owner has full control over the group (including the ability to change the
membership type of other users or add/remove the group's permissions.)  An np-owner is
like an owner but does not inherit permissions from the group. Technically, groups are
members of other groups.</p>

<h3>What's the deal with permissions?</h3>
<p>Grouper <a href="/permissions">permissions</a> are just enumerated strings. First,
permissions are first created (added to the set of available permissions.) Then
permissions are granted to groups as (permission, argument) pairs where an argument is an
optional second string. Finally, users inherit the union of all (permission, argument)
pairs from the groups of which they are members.</p>

<h3>How do I request a permission?</h3>
<p>First, make sure you're a member of an appropriate group.  We don't grant permissions
directly to users because that approach is not scalable.  Once you're a member of a group
that should have a particular permission but doesn't, check the {{permission(grant_perm)}}
page for a list of which groups can grant which permissions and reach out to the group(s)
that control(s) the permission you need.</p>

<h3>Who can create groups?</h3>
<p>Everyone.  The user creating a group automatically becomes an owner of that group,
which begins with no permissions.</p>

<h3>Who can create users?</h3>
<!-- TODO: update language once users can be prepopulated. -->
<p>Users are automatically populated into Grouper as they visit the web UI.  We're working
on a manual way to pre-populate users.</p>

<h3>Who can create permissions?</h3>
<p>A user with the permission ({{permission(create_perm)}}, prefix.*) can create any
permission starting with "prefix." We strongly encourage namespacing using the character
'.' as a separator.</p>

<h3>Who can grant permissions?</h3>
<p>Generally, a user with the permission ({{permission(grant_perm)}}, prefix.*) can grant
any permission starting with "prefix." with any argument.  As a special case, the
permission ({{grant_perm.name}}, {{grant_perm.name}}/prefix.*) allows a user to
grant the permission to grant ({{grant_perm.name}}, prefix.*).</p>

<h3>How does auditing work?</h3>
<p>Certain grouper permissions are designated as audited permissions. Groups with at least
one audited permission become audited groups.  Users with the {{permission(audit_perm)}}
permission (any argument) are considered auditors.  Only auditors can be the manager,
owner, or np-owner of an audited group.</p>

<!-- TODO: change once auditing tooling is ready! -->
<p>We're working on tooling to facilitate regular monitoring of both members of audited
  groups and groups with audited permissions.</p>
